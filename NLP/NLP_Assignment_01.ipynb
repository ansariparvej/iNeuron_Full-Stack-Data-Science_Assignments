    "Q1. Explain One-Hot Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "\n",
    "One hot encoding can be defined as the essential process of converting the categorical data variables to be provided to machine and deep learning algorithms which in turn improve predictions as well as classification accuracy of a model\n",
    "\n",
    "Categorical data refers to variables that are made up of label values, for example, a “color” variable could have the values “red“, “blue, and “green”. Think of values like different categories that sometimes have a natural ordering to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some machine learning algorithms can work directly with categorical data depending on implementation, such as a decision tree, but most require any inputs or outputs variables to be a number, or numeric in value. This means that any categorical data must be mapped to integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "One hot encoding is one method of converting data to prepare it for an algorithm and get a better prediction. With one-hot, we convert each categorical value into a new categorical column and assign a binary value of 1 or 0 to those columns. Each integer value is represented as a binary vector. All the values are zero, and the index is marked with a 1"

    "A bag of words is a representation of text that describes the occurrence of words within a document. We just keep track of word counts and disregard the grammatical details and the word order. It is called a “bag” of words because any information about the order or structure of words in the document is discarded.

    "\n",
    "Continuous Bag of Words Model (CBOW): Both are architectures to learn the underlying word representations for each word by using neural networks. ... In the CBOW model, the distributed representations of context (or surrounding words) are combined to predict the word in the middle .\n",
    "\n",
    "The CBOW model tries to understand the context of the words and takes this as input. It then tries to predict words that are contextually accurate. Let us consider an example for understanding this. Consider the sentence: ‘It is a pleasant day’ and the word ‘pleasant’ goes as input to the neural network. We are trying to predict the word ‘day’ here. We will use the one-hot encoding for the input words and measure the error rates with the one-hot encoded target word. Doing this will help us predict the output based on the word with least error."

    "The main idea behind the Skip-Gram model is this: it takes every word in a large corpora (we will call it the focus word) and also takes one-by-one the words that surround it within a defined 'window' to then feed a neural network that after training will predict the probability for each word to actually appear in the window around the focus word."
