    "Ans: \n",
    "\n",
    "In Sequence to Sequence Learning, RNN is trained to map an input sequence to an output sequence which is not necessarily of the same length.\n",
    "\n",
    "Applications are speech recognition, machine translation, image captioning and question answering.\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable-length context vector can be used instead of a ﬁxed-size vector. An Attention mechanism can be used to produces a sequence of vectors from the encoder RNN from each time step of the input sequence. The Decoder learns to pay selective attention to the vectors to produce the output at each time step.\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "This two-step model, called an Encoder–Decoder, works much better than trying to translate on the fly with a single sequence-to-sequence RNN (like the one represented on the top left), since the last words of a sentence can affect the first words of the translation, so you need to wait until you have heard the whole sentence before translating it. Seq-2-seq RNNs translate one word at a time where as encoder-decoder RNNs read & translate a sentence at a time\n",
